# Python Neural Net

This is a basic neural network trainer implemented in pure Python (with numpy). I trained it on MNIST (hand written digits) as an example and included an interactive visualization in javascript.

## Installation

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

The only core dependency is numpy. scikit-image is also needed for the example for training MNIST (for augmenting the training data).
